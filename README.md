# Compeer API

A simple API to vote on paired items in a list

## Usage

### Register a user

URL: `/auth/register`  
DATA:  
* `username`: Username of the person to register  
* `email`: Email of the person to register  
* `password`: Raw password of the user (will be sent over SSL in the final so its
secure enough.

RESPONSE:
* `200 - OK` with no body if the user was made  
* `400 - Bad Request` if the username is taken, or you are missing any fields.
The body will contain a dictionary of all your goofs so you should be ok to show
the user them.

### Get a token for a registered user

URL: `/auth/get-token`  
DATA:  
* `username`:  Username of the person to log in.  
* `password`: Raw password of the person to log in.

RESPONSES:  
* `200 - OK` with a body containing a dictionary with one parameter, `token`, which is a string.  
* `400 - Bad Request` for wrong username / password. Also returns a dict of all the errors.

NOTES:  
* Tokens do not expire, you could log in once and then forever authenticate.

### Lists

You can POST to create lists, or GEt to get lists. GET returns the items as nested values.

General structure (note the score / rank is not included right now):
```javascript
{
    "id": 0,
    "title": "Top TV shows",
    "description": "Pretty self explainatry aye",
    "action_word": "better"
    "items": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "caption": "Bobs Burgers",
            "description": "Bob makes burger. Hilarity ensues"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "caption": "Archer",
            "description": "The worlds most famous secret agent"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Making a list

To make a list you must be authenticated, or else you will get a 401.

You need to `POST` to `/list/` with the data `caption`, `description` and optionally `action_word`.


#### Getting or updating a list

To view info about a list, you must know its PK. Then make a GET request to `/list/<pk>`. It will match the structure above.

AFAIK you can also PUT/PATCH to the url to modify information of the list. But I couldn't get the tests green.


### Items

API is pretty similar to lists, where you can create by `POST`ing to `\item\` and can update/view with `\item\<pk>`.

Right now images are not given at all, although I think you can upload them. Next on the todo list is to make it so images are provided as a URL to the image file.

Note, in order to create an item you must be authenticated as the owner of the associated list.

#### Get structure

Note: The list is provided as an ID rather than a nested structure
```javascript
{
    "id": 0,
    "list": 7, 
    "caption": "Bobs Burgers",
    "description": "Bob makes burger. Hilarity ensues"
}
```

#### POST data

To create an item, you need to provide a caption & description in the post data. You
will also need to provide the PK of the associated list with the parameter name `list`.  

### Hello World

URL: `/hello-world`  
DATA:  
* Optional token header to make an authenticated request.

RESPONSE:  
* `Hello world` if you are anonymous (no token / un recognised)
* `Hello <username>` if you have the token (the tests fail for this... unverified).
